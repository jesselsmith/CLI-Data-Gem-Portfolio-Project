Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow the coding conventions (below).


Coding conventions
Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. Optimize for readability:

  -Indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  -ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
  -This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
